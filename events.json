Bitcoin and Beer are provided.\nJoin us for an evening of Bitcoin and Beers where we educate and empower entrepreneurs by showcasing the practical uses of bitcoin and other digital currencies in everyday transactions. Attendees will learn the fundamentals of bitcoin, including its operational mechanics, benefits, and potential impacts on their businesses.\nTo enhance the experience, participants will receive a small amount of bitcoin to make real-time purchases, such as buying beers, allowing them to directly engage with and understand the technology, thereby gaining hands-on experience with bitcoin transactions.\nThis hands-on approach demystifies bitcoin and provides a unique networking opportunity among local business leaders.\nCo-hosted by Myna Accountants CEO, Joe David, and BTCGlos Exec, Matthew Bax, the event not only aims to educate but also to foster networking among local business owners, creating a supportive community of forward-thinking professionals eager to embrace new financial technologies. Registration is required, and admission is free, making it an accessible and valuable event for all local entrepreneurs interested in the future of digital payments.",
